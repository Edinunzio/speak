# speak

*In case you can't tell, this is a work in progress.*

Speak, is an attempt to make a bare bones django-based cms blogging platform. This setup is using Postgres on the back-end, but any SQL database should work fine. Check the [official docs on django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/) on configuring your database in your project's `settings.py`.
 
The [wiki](https://github.com/Edinunzio/speak/wiki) is in placeholder mode and will be updated as the project progresses.

[Check here]([screenshots](https://github.com/Edinunzio/speak/wiki/Screenshots) for current screenshots. These will definitely change as the project grows.
